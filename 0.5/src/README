Mechanic - Hacking your car

This library allows you to query some diagnostic values from
your car using an Arduino and a CAN shield (I recommend the
on from Watterott, but Sparkfun should also work just fine).
It assumes your car provides an OBD-II port that supports the
CAN bus (which should be true for most vehicles, since it is
a standard since 2008).

Installation is easy: Just get the latest release from the
downloads page and place the contents of the "src" directory in a
"Mechanis" directory under your Arduino "libraries" directory.
Then restart Arduino. You should now see a bunch of new examples
that teach you how to use Mechanic. The "Misc/SelfTest" example
is a good way of validating your setup.

The repository also contains a small Android app that shows
a live dashboard with some values transmitted from Arduino via
Bluetooth (I use an inexpensive Bluetooth board from MiB
instruments, but, again, there is no reason why others shouldn't
work just as well.

For documentation on the functions I currently recommend to read
the comments in the "Mechanic.h" header file. There is also an
article in c't Hardware Hacks 2/2013.

The library itself is made available under the GNU Lesser General
Public License (LGPL). See the LICENSE file for details. All
examples except the test suite are licensed under the Creative
Commons Zero license, which effectively makes them public domain.
The test suite is also licensed under the LGPL.

Railuino uses parts of Fabian Greif's CAN library, which is
(c) 2007-2012 Fabian Greif and licensed under a BSD-style license.

Have fun!
